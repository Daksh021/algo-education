# Monty Hall problem in python

# The Monty Hall Problem is like this:

# 1.The show has three doors. A prize like a car or vacation is behind a door, and the other two doors hide a worthless prize called a Zonk; in most discussions of the problem, the Zonk is a goat.
# 2.The competitor chooses a door. Weâ€™ll assume that the entrant has no internal knowledge of which gate is holding the prize, so the entrant will simply make a random choice.
# 3.Smiling host Monty Hall opens one of the other doors, always choosing the one that shows a goat, and always offers the contestant a chance to change their choice for the remaining unopened door.
# 4.The competitor chooses to change the gate or chooses to stick to the first choice.

    # Presenter removes the first door that was not selected neither winning

    # Player decides to change its choice
    if change:
        selecteddoor = next(i for i in range(3) if i != selecteddoor and i != removeddoor)

    # We suppose the player never wants to change its initial choice.
